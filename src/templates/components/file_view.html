<div class="file-view-container">
    <!--
        Container to display the content of the selected file.

        Constraints:
        - This container expects content to be injected dynamically via JavaScript.
        - Supports both plain text and Markdown rendering.

        DO NOT CHANGE:
        - The ID 'file-content' is used by the JavaScript functions to insert content.
        - Modifying the structure may break file viewing functionality.
